            <p>Our favourite artists come to play where we live, but we miss them because that info is lost in the noise.</p>

            <p>Social media leads to short form, superficial content, read in a few seconds before being scrolled away. This system prevents artists
              from providing us with high quality, deeper content.</p>

            <p>We listen to a massive variety of artists over time. Manually following every one of them on social media isn&apos;t sustainable.</p>
